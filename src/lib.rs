//! Thread priority. A library for changing thread's priority.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Setting thread priority to minimum:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use thread_priority::*;
//!
//! let result = set_current_thread_priority(ThreadPriority::Min);
//! // Or like this:
//! let result = ThreadPriority::Min.set_for_current();
//! ```
